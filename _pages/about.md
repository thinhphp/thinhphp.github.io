I am an AI Resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/) under the supervision of [Dr. Dat Quoc Nguyen](https://datquocnguyen.github.io/). Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Science, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh city. I also won the second prize in Vietnamese Olympiad in Informatics, participated in National ACM ICPC competition, etc.

My research interest lies in **multilingual NLP, multimodality, and retrieval-argumented models**. I also welcome the opportunity to expand my horizons and delve into new interesting topics.
