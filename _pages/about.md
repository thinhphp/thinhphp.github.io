Hi, I am a first-year PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/) (VT), advised by Prof. [Tu Vu](https://tuvllms.github.io/). 

Previously, I spent 2 years working as an AI Resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/) under the supervision of Dr. [Dat Quoc Nguyen](https://datquocnguyen.github.io/). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Science, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh city.
<!-- I am deeply interested in natural language processing (NLP) and LLMs. I welcome the opportunity to expand my horizons and delve into new interesting topics. -->
