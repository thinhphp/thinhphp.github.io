Hi, I am a first-year PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/) (VT), advised by Prof. [Tu Vu](https://tuvllms.github.io/). My research is centered on developing effective and efficient methods for LLMs. My goal is to advance the development of LLMs that can be applied to a wide range of real-world applications.

Previously, I spent 2 years working as an AI Resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/) under the supervision of Dr. [Dat Quoc Nguyen](https://datquocnguyen.github.io/). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Science, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh city.
<!-- I am deeply interested in natural language processing (NLP) and LLMs. I welcome the opportunity to expand my horizons and delve into new interesting topics. -->

## Research interests
I am now focusing on improving LLMs' complex reasoning skills by injecting knowledge from external tools, including:
* **Tool-use LLMs**: utilizing external tools to enhance their capabilities to access and process relevant information outside knowledge cut-off in pre-training stage.
* **Complex reasoning**: developing methods to improve LLMs' ability to engage in sophisticated reasoning processes.
